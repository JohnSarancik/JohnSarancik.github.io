<h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class= "aboutMe">My name is John Henry Sarancik (sir-an-sick) and I love to play games (video games, board games, tabletop games, etc). My particular favorites would have to be Magic The Gathering and Warhammer 40k. I have recently picked up programming and am relatively new at this but I love it and I am aiming for a career in it. So far, the programming languages I have had at least a small chance to work in include, html, css, p5js, python, c#, and c++.</p>
